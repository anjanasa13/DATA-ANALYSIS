This analysis aids users in gaining insights into whether their time was spent productively, creatively, or if there was time wastage. By scrutinizing screen time, it becomes possible to uncover relationships between smartphone usage and factors such as notifications and the specific apps employed by the user. This exploration can shed light on patterns, preferences, and dependencies, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of how individuals interact with their smartphones and the impact on their overall engagement and efficiency.\n\n\nAnalyze the screen time of the user to find relationships between the usage of the smartphone and factors like notifications and apps used by the user.\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Importing the necessary python libraries and the dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/analyzing-screen-time/Screentime - App Details.csv\")\nprint(data.head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-03T14:04:51.062329Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-03T14:04:51.062697Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-03T14:04:52.301819Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-03T14:04:51.062663Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-03T14:04:52.299925Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Check for null values in the dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.isnull().sum()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-03T14:04:52.305430Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-03T14:04:52.305801Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-03T14:04:52.324838Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-03T14:04:52.305766Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-03T14:04:52.323183Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are no null values in the dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let us look into the descriptive statistics of the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data.describe())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-03T14:04:52.328593Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-03T14:04:52.332464Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-03T14:04:52.352809Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-03T14:04:52.332413Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-03T14:04:52.351939Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Analyzing the screen time of user: app usage\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import plotly.express as px\n\nfigure = px.bar(data_frame=data, \n                x=\"Date\", \n                y=\"Usage\", \n                color=\"App\", \n                title=\"Usage\",\n                labels={\"Usage\": \"Screen Time (minutes)\", \"Date\": \"Date\"},\n                height=500,  #
